# LISTS
# Since users can collaborate on lists (owner, r/w, read-only) this needs to
# facilitate access to the list metadata for all lists that a user has access to.
#
# So hitting these endpoints returns all list collaborations metadata for a
# user's list(s)

/users/<uid:int>/lists
- post (becomes owner)
- get

/users/<uid:int>lists/<lid:int>
- get
- put (permission dependent)
- delete (permission dependent)
